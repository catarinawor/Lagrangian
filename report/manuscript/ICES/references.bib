The origin of the management procedure (MP) approach (sometimes termed management strategy evaluation), with its simulation testing of feedback-control algorithms as a necessary and structured basis for dealing with the inevitable uncertainties associated with fisheries assessments, is briefly reviewed. Also discussed are the advantages that overcome some of the difficulties of the “traditional” approach of coupling an annual “best” assessment to some harvest control rule, such as a failure to consider longer-term trade-offs properly. The MP approach does, however, also have disadvantages, such as the length of time typically required for its development and an argued inflexibility after implementation. Solutions that have been developed to overcome some of these difficulties are discussed.},

	shorttitle = {Pacific hake, {Merluccius} productus, autecology},
	abstract = {Pacific hake, Merluccius productus, the most abundant groundfish in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME), is a species of both commercial significance, supporting a large international fishery, and ecological importance, connecting other species as both predator and prey. Coastal Pacific hake migrations are characterized by movements between northern summer feeding areas and southern winter spawning areas, with variations in annual abundance, distribution, and the extent of these movements associated with varying climate-ocean conditions. In general, warm (cool) years with enhanced (reduced) stratification and poleward (equatorward) transport are often related to good (poor) recruitment, increased (decreased) northward distribution, and reduced (enhanced) growth. However, the classic periodic pattern of annual migration and distribution may no longer be fully representative. Based on recent advances in the understanding of climate-ocean variability off the U.S. west coast, we hypothesize that the annual movements of Pacific hake are more responsive to climate-ocean variability than previously thought, and further, that changes observed in Pacific hake distributions may reflect long-term changes in climate-ocean conditions in the CCLME. Therefore, an updated model of these relations is key to effective monitoring and management of this stock, as well as to devising scenarios of future change in the CCLME as a result of climate variations. The current state of knowledge of the relationship between the Pacific hake and its environment is reviewed, highlighting emerging ideas compared to those of the past, and priorities for future research are suggested.},

Simulations were conducted to evaluate economic and conservation outcomes of full and partial cooperative and non-cooperative transboundary management of Pacific sardine fishing under different climate change scenarios. The results suggest the following: (1) full cooperative management by the three countries is necessary to achieve sustainable fisheries; and (2) unilateral efforts to maximize conservation and management benefits would not be successful with climate change.},

	abstract = {Fisheries management is characterized by multiple and conflicting objectives, multiple stakeholders with divergent interests and high levels of uncertainty about the dynamics of the resources being managed. This conjunction of issues can result in high levels of contention and poor outcomes in the management process. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) can assist in the resolution of these issues. MSE involves assessing the consequences of a range of management options and laying bare the trade-offs in performance across a range of management objectives. Key steps in the approach involve turning broad objectives into specific and quantifiable performance indicators, identifying and incorporating key uncertainties in the evaluation, and communicating the results effectively to client groups and decision-makers. At a technical level, the framework facilitates dealing with multiple objectives and uncertainties in prediction. At the implementation level, it fails if it cannot accommodate effective stakeholder participation and acceptance. MSE shares many features with approaches such as adaptive management and development of management procedures. The principles for implementing the MSE approach are reviewed and practical aspects of its implementation under the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) partnership model to fisheries management are discussed. The model stresses stakeholder involvement in all key areas of fisheries management, from stock assessment and setting research priorities, to enforcement and decision-making. Stakeholder involvement, including industry, science, and conservation, extends from membership of the AFMA Board, through Management Advisory Committees to Fisheries Assessment Groups. The benefits and limitations of the AFMA partnership approach are reviewed, both for MSE, and, in a wider sense, in the development of an effective fisheries management system.},

	abstract = {Research vessel surveys showed that yellowtail flounder (Pleuronectes ferruginea) on the Grand Bank, off New-foundland in the Northwest Atlantic, declined in abundance between the 1970s and the mid 1990s. The northern limit of distribution decreased substantially in the late 1980s and early 1990s, coincident with large declines in population abundance and a decrease in bottom water temperatures. This range contraction continued into the mid 1990s, despite a stabilization of the population size and a reversal of the cooling trend. In 1995, this species was rarely found on the northern Grand Bank. The area west of the Southeast Shoal on the southern Grand Bank had relatively high densities of yellowtail flounder throughout the period studied. The area occupied by the stock was positively correlated with stock abundance from surveys, but not with bottom temperatures from these same surveys. We conclude that the contraction in the area of distribution for this stock to the preferred habitat around the Southeast Shoal is primarily a function of low stock size, which resulted from increased fishing activity in the mid to late 1980s.},

Persistent productivity changes imply downward adjustment in spawning abundance targets during periods of low productivity, while conservation constraints simply imply upper limits on exploitation rate at high stock sizes. When the economic objective is to maximize the logarithm of net income (diminishing marginal utility or welfare from higher incomes), the optimum control rule shifts from a fixed escapement form to a curve where exploitation rate increases smoothly from zero at the minimum stock size that can be fished profitably to the upper limit set by a conservation constraint.

	abstract = {Harvest policies use control rules and associated policy parameters to dictate how fishing mortality or catch and yield levels are determined, and are necessary for rational management. Common control rules include constant catch, constant fishing mortality rate, constant escapement, or a few variations of these. The “best” among these control rules for meeting common fishery objectives (e.g., maximizing yield) is a source of controversy in the literature, and results are seemingly contradictory. To compare the ability of control rules to meet widely used fishery objectives and identify potential causes for these apparently contradictory results, we did a detailed review of relevant literature. The relative performance of control rules at meeting common fishery objectives is affected by: whether uncertainty in estimated stock sizes is included in analyses, whether the maximum recruitment level (e.g., the asymptote of a Beverton–Holt stock–recruit function) is varied in an autocorrelated fashion over time, fishery objectives, and the amount of compensation in the stock–recruit relationship. Few studies have compared control rules using optimal parameters (e.g., those that maximize some objective function) that were found while including assessment error. More commonly, parameters that are optimal without assessment error are used in a comparison of control rules that includes assessment error. This approach can produce misleading results. Ideally, selection of a control rule and policy parameters is done within the framework of a stochastic simulation that considers key uncertainties. If this is not feasible, an alternative option is to “borrow” control rules from a similar fishery and set policy parameters based on biological reference points developed for a species with similar taxonomy and life-history traits. More research is needed to compare control rules when accounting for uncertainty in key population parameters, when stock–recruitment or other population dynamic parameters vary over time, and for fisheries with non-yield-based or competing objectives.},

A collaborative management strategy evaluation approach and closed-loop simulation modelling was used to evaluate expected fishery economic and conservation performance of the sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) fishery in British Columbia (Canada), in the presence of uncertainty about BRPs. Comparison of models derived using two precautionary harvest control rules, which each complied with biological conservation objectives and short-term economic objectives given by industry, suggested that both rules were likely to avert biomass decline below limit BRPs, even when stock biomass and production were persistently overestimated by stock assessment models. The slightly less conservative, industry-preferred harvest control rule also avoided short-term economic losses of c. CAN\$ 2.7–10 million annually, or 10–50\% of current landed value. Distinguishing between the role of BRPs in setting fishery conservation objectives and operational control points that define harvest control rules improved the flexibility of the sablefish management system, and has led to adoption of precautionary management procedures.},

Conservative assessments (low biomass estimates for which there is only a small probability that biomass is actually lower) are favored during development when loss is measured as the relative departure from the best quota for each year.

This equation shows that persistent overestimates of biomass during stock declines are caused mainly by three factors: first-order autoregressive effects of past errors, hyperstability in relative abundance indices, and overestimates of current recruitment. Besides exposing these main causes of bias in biomass estimation, the equation can be used to develop very efficient closed-loop or management performance simulations and to provide timely biomass estimates in situations where it is not practical or economical to carry out full assessments every year., Les erreurs des estimations de biomasse courante exploitable dans les modèles d'évaluation de stock avec structure en âge se répercutent généralement dans le temps comme si elles avaient été calculées à l'aide d'une équation très simple du filtre de Kalman. Cette équation démontre que des surestimations répétées de la biomasse alors que les stocks diminuent peuvent être dues à trois facteurs, soit, les effets d'autorégression de premier ordre des erreurs du passé, l'hyperstabilité des indices d'abondance relative et la surestimation du recrutement actuel. En plus de mettre en lumière ces causes principales d'erreur dans les estimations de biomasse, l'équation peut servir à mettre au point des simulations très efficaces en boucle fermée ou de performance de gestion et elle peut fournir des estimations de la biomasse en temps opportun lorsqu'il n'est pas pratique ou économique de faire une évaluation complète chaque année.[Traduit par la Rédaction]},

A simulation model of an age-structured population with stochastic recruitment was constructed with such a harvest policy with several threshold levels. Other factors were fishing mortality, recruitment, and initial biomass. The objective function was a weighted function of average yield and standard deviation over a planning horizon. First, we determined the optimal threshold given fishing mortality. Secondly, we determined optimal threshold and fishing mortality, simultaneously. In application to eastern Bering Sea pollock, a threshold management policy always increased average yield over a non-threshold policy. For the first problem, optimal threshold levels ranged from 20 to 30\% of pristine biomass. For the second problem, each scenario had a unique threshold and fishing mortality, with fishing mortality slightly above the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) level and a threshold..., Une politique de gestion basée sur un seuil permet de maintenir un taux de capture constant; toutefois, il faut cesser la pêche dès que l'effectif se trouve sous ce seuil.

	abstract = {Despite broad recognition of the potential for significant spatial complexity in morphological, behavioral, and life-history traits within many fish populations, fisheries are commonly managed across large spatial scales that aggregate interacting sub-populations into single management units. Such mis-match between the ecological and management scales may lead to a loss of spatial diversity and a restricted ability of populations to adapt and persist in the presence of changing environmental conditions. Developing harvest strategies for spatially complex fish populations therefore remains a major challenge. In this study, we evaluate whether managing spatially complex fish stocks as large-scale aggregates leads to greater conservation risks. We develop a closed-loop simulation model that represents a range of dispersal scenarios and includes imperfect management knowledge about the abundances and dynamics of interacting Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) sub-populations, as well as weak management control of how exploitation is allocated among sub-populations. The latter is driven by the spatial dynamics of the fishing fleet as it seeks to optimize profitability. Simulated management outcomes did not always lead to increased risks under all scenarios of dispersal, fishery spatial dynamics, and management errors. Instead, these processes interacted to either mediate or intensify the impact of inappropriate management assumptions and stock assessment errors. Management strategies aimed directly at limiting exploitation risk consistently protected spatially complex populations in the presence of incorrect management assumptions about stock structure, high fishing power, and persistent stock assessment errors. Given the pervasiveness of these errors in fisheries, we recommend further evaluation of spatio-temporal refugia for tactical management of spatially complex fish populations.},

The analyses explore the medium- to long-term implications of uncertainty about the steepness of the stock–recruitment relationship, variation as well as possible temporal autocorrelation in recruitment, and estimation and implementation uncertainty. The results highlight the trade-offs among various management strategies, in particular the trade-offs between average catch, inter-annual variation in catch, and the risk of dropping below the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) overfished threshold of 25\% of the average unfished spawning biomass. Uncertainty regarding steepness is the major source of variation in the final size of the resource and whether it is below the overfished threshold, although the extent of recruitment variability also impacts these quantities. The extent of inter-annual variation in catches is determined primarily by the amount of implementation error. Although the values for the various performance measures depend on all of the factors examined to some extent, the impact of interactions among these factors is generally small.},

With refined understanding of spatial population structures, scientists have begun to address how spatiotemporal mismatches among the scale of ecological processes, data collection programs, and stock assessment methods (or assumptions) influence the reliability and, ultimately, appropriateness of regional fishery management (e.g., assigning regional quotas). Development and evaluation of spatial modeling techniques to improve fisheries assessment and management have increased rapidly in recent years. We overview the historical context of spatial models in fisheries science, highlight recent advances in spatial modeling, and discuss how spatial models have been incorporated into the management process. Despite limited examples where spatial assessment models are used as the basis for management advice, continued investment in fine-scale data collection and associated spatial analyses will improve integration of spatial dynamics and ecosystem-level interactions in stock assessment. In the near future, spatiotemporal fisheries management advice will increasingly rely on fine-scale outputs from spatial analyses.},

	abstract = {Optimal harvesting policies are commonly derived by assuming a time-invariant relationship between some productivity measure and the resource variable under control. Yet, long-term trends in the environment appear to induce persistent changes in spawning success in several fish stocks. I show that when predictable trends in environmental effects are incorporated into stock-recruitment models, optimal policies respond to changing environmental conditions in a way that depends very much on the management objective. When the goal is to maximize expected discounted yield, resulting risk-neutral policies computed for a model of a cyclic iteroparous population respond by continuously adjusting optimal spawning targets in phase with the environmental cycle: escapements are raised when favorable conditions are anticipated and they are lowered when poor environments are expected. These feedback responses reinforce recruitment fluctuations and lead to a sequence of boom and bust periods in the fishery. Policies shift diametrically when a risk-averse objective is pursued such as maximization of the expected sum of discounted logarithms of catches. Optimal escapements closely parallel fluctuations in population abundance, with harvest rates and catches much less variable than in the risk-neutral policy. Harvest rates respond in a compensatory way to changes in population abundance, anticipated environmental conditions, and expected strength of incoming year-classes. Depending on the specific model used, a constant harvest rate strategy may perform nearly as well as the optimal. Analytical results are provided that characterize risk-neutral optimal policies for stochastic delay-difference population models. Results show that knowledge of current environmental conditions can be used to construct harvest policies which are nearly as good as those “optimal” ones based on long-term environmental forecasts.},

	abstract = {Fisheries management is conducted to achieve sustainable use of fishery resources, mainly through regulation of fishing activities. For almost a decade, the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna (CCSBT) struggled to reach agreement on a total allowable catch (TAC) for southern bluefin tuna (SBT) because of stock assessment uncertainties. To address this, in 2002 the CCSBT commenced development of a management procedure (MP), a pre-agreed set of rules to determine how the TAC will be adjusted as new monitoring data become available. The CCSBT Scientific Committee tested various candidate MPs using operating models which simulate fish population and fishery dynamics as well as incorporate process, observation, and model uncertainties. Candidate MPs were evaluated using performance measures related to the following management objectives: maximize catches, avoid stock collapse, and minimize interannual catch variation. Of the MPs explored, some relied solely on empirical data [i.e., adjusted TAC based on catch per unit effort (CPUE) trends], whereas others were more complicated, based on population models. In 2005, the CCSBT adopted a model-based MP that realized a moderate catch with low variability and avoided stock collapse. This MP struck a compromise between the risk-prone and risk-averse standpoints of the different stakeholders. However, despite this concerted scientific effort, the MP was not implemented because, shortly after its adoption, it became evident that historical catches may have been substantially underreported. This complication necessitates returning to near the beginning of the development process. MP approaches have various advantages and challenges to be explored further. However, it is essential to lessen human-introduced uncertainty (such as catch misreporting) by enhanced enforcement, and to increase management robustness to biological uncertainties by implementing MPs.},

Consideration is given to how the outcome depends on the nature of the stock's migrations. Two types of migrations are considered: (i) density-dependent, where the mackerel migrates into the Icelandic economic zone only if it exceeds 3.5 million t, and (ii) stochastic migrations, where the said migrations are stochastic. It is determined that the Faroe Islands would never accept a cooperative solution wherein they can only fish with the globally optimal fishing mortality within their own zone. This is also true for Iceland when the migrations into her zone are stochastic, but not if they are density-dependent. In the latter case, the other players have incentives to retaliate to Icelandic overfishing by fishing harder, which greatly reduces the number of years when mackerel are available in the Icelandic zone. It is assumed that the objective is maximization of the catch volume over a time-horizon of 50 years.},

	abstract = {We studied cooperative and competitive solutions for managing a trans-boundary fish stock that has a stock-size dependent distribution and harvesting costs, using Norwegian spring-spawning (NSS) herring (Clupea harengus) as a case study. This is among the first studies to investigate the effect of a dynamic distribution in a partition function game framework, i.e., including externalities. The special feature of NSS herring is that it comes under the sole ownership of Norway when the stock size is sufficiently low. The three players in our game are differentiated by stock ownership, cost per unit effort and stock elasticity of harvest. We find that cost asymmetry improves the likelihood of forming a stable grand coalition as harvesting load can be assigned to each fishing zone according to a player's relative cost level and the density of fish. A dynamic distribution increases the bargaining power of Norway because of her ability to control both the total stock and the stock shares in different zones, especially during the stock transition years. However, the bargaining power of Norway may disappear if her cost of harvesting exceeds that of the other players. This loss of bargaining power can take on two forms: first, a dynamic distribution may encourage a minor player to free ride because Norway, needing a coalition partner to improve her cost-effectiveness, would be less inclined to retaliate as retaliation hurts her ally as much as the free-rider; second, in a stable grand coalition, Norway is not guaranteed to receive an allocation of benefit shares in proportion to (not to say in excess of) her stock ownership. At the current stock condition, the strategy where Norway reduces stock abundance below the level where the stock becomes non-migratory is found attractive only if the discounting rate is sufficiently high.},

	abstract = {The distribution pattern of albacore, Thunnus alalunga, in the Indian Ocean was analyzed based on catch data from the Taiwanese tuna longline fishery during the period 1979–85. The Taiwanese tuna fishery began operating in the Indian Ocean in 1967. We used a geographic information system to compile a fishery and environmental database and statistically explored the catch per unit effort (CPUE) distribution of albacore. Our results indicated that immature albacore were mainly distributed in areas south of 30°S although some displayed a north–south seasonal migration. Mature albacore, which were mainly concentrated between 10°S and 25°S, also showed a north–south migration. Within 10°S and 30°S, the separation of mature, spawning, and immature albacore life history stages roughly coincided with the boundaries of the three oceanic current systems in the Indian Ocean. The optimal environmental variables for CPUE prediction by stepwise discriminant analysis differed among life history stages. For immature albacore, the sea surface variables sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll concentration and surface salinity were significant. For mature albacore, SST was significant, while for spawning albacore, the sub-surface variables temperature at 100 m and oxygen at 200 m were significant. Spawning albacore evidently prefer deep oceanographic conditions. Our results on the oceanographic conditions preferred by different developmental stages of albacore in the Indian Ocean were compatible with previous studies found in the Pacific Ocean.},

	abstract = {Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) is considered to be overfished, but the status of its populations has been debated, partly because of uncertainties regarding the effects of mixing on fishing grounds. A better understanding of spatial structure and mixing may help fisheries managers to successfully rebuild populations to sustainable levels while maximizing catches. We formulate a new seasonally and spatially explicit fisheries model that is fitted to conventional and electronic tag data, historic catch-at-age reconstructions, and otolith microchemistry stock-composition data to improve the capacity to assess past, current, and future population sizes of Atlantic bluefin tuna. We apply the model to estimate spatial and temporal mixing of the eastern (Mediterranean) and western (Gulf of Mexico) populations, and to reconstruct abundances from 1950 to 2008. We show that western and eastern populations have been reduced to 17\% and 33\%, respectively, of 1950 spawning stock biomass levels. Overfishing to below the biomass that produces maximum sustainable yield occurred in the 1960s and the late 1990s for western and eastern populations, respectively. The model predicts that mixing depends on season, ontogeny, and location, and is highest in the western Atlantic. Assuming that future catches are zero, western and eastern populations are predicted to recover to levels at maximum sustainable yield by 2025 and 2015, respectively. However, the western population will not recover with catches of 1750 and 12,900 tonnes (the “rebuilding quotas”) in the western and eastern Atlantic, respectively, with or without closures in the Gulf of Mexico. If future catches are double the rebuilding quotas, then rebuilding of both populations will be compromised. If fishing were to continue in the eastern Atlantic at the unregulated levels of 2007, both stocks would continue to decline. Since populations mix on North Atlantic foraging grounds, successful rebuilding policies will benefit from trans-Atlantic cooperation.},

	abstract = {Misidentifying spatial population structure may result in harvest levels that are unable to achieve management goals. We developed a spatially explicit simulation model to determine how biological reference points differ among common population structures and to investigate the performance of management quantities that were calculated assuming incorrect spatial population dynamics. Simulated reference points were compared across a range of population structures and connectivity scenarios demonstrating the influence of spatial assumptions on management benchmarks. Simulations also illustrated that applying a harvest level based on misdiagnosed spatial structure leads to biased stock status indicators, overharvesting, or foregone yield. Across the scenarios examined, incorrectly specifying the connectivity dynamics (particularly misdiagnosing source–sink dynamics) was often more detrimental than ignoring spatial structure altogether. However, when the true dynamics exhibited spatial structure, incorrectly assuming panmictic structure resulted in severe depletion if harvesting concentrated on more productive population units (instead of being homogeneously distributed). Incorporating spatially generalized operating models, such as the one developed here, into management strategy evaluations will help develop management procedures that are more robust to spatial complexities.},
